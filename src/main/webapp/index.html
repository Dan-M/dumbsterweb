	<h2>Welcome to Dumbster Web</h2>
	<div>
		Dumbster Web is a simple web application that wraps <a
			href="http://quintanasoft.com/dumbster/">Dumbster</a>, a fake SMTP
		Server. It's purpose is to support integration testing of applications
		that need to send emails.
	</div>
	<br />
	<div>
		If you see this page, a <a
			href="http://quintanasoft.com/dumbster/javadoc/index.html">SimpleSmtpServer</a>
		has already been started. Configure the application to be tested to use
		<ul>
			<div class="lift:hello.server">
			<li>mail.smtp.host = <span id="hostname">hostName</span></li>
			</div>
			<div class="lift:hello.port">
			<li>mail.smtp.port = <span id="port">port</span></li>
			</div>
		</ul>
		and deploy it for system / integration testing.
	</div>
	<br />
	<div>
		You can now either <a href="test.html">Test</a> the SMTP server by sending
		a mail to it from this application or you can check the <a href="mails.html">Mails</a>
		that the server has already recieved.
